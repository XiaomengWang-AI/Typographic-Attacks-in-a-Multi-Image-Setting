# Typographic-Attacks-in-a-Multi-Image-Setting
This repository contains the source code and experimental data for the paper "Typographic Attacks in a Multi-Image Setting" presented at NAACL 2025. 

This paper propose a realistic multi-image setting and effective attack strategies in this setting.
This paper explores the vulnerabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and InstructBLIP, to typographic attacks where texts are superimposed on images to cause misclassifications.
